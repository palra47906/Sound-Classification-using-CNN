ðŸŽ§ Urban Sound Classifier
This project is a machine learning application built using Streamlit and TensorFlow that classifies urban sound recordings. 
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the UrbanSound8K dataset to predict various sound categories based on uploaded .wav audio files. 
The model's predictions are displayed along with visualizations like the mel spectrogram and audio waveform.
